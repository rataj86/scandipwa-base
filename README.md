## Docker Setup

The docker environment is prepared to deploy and develop the theme.
We recommend using it as:

- It has pre-configured services
- No need to have an existing Magento installation
- Rendertrone out of the box
- It has a development-friendly setup

>**NOTE!** Currently, the docker setup is supported only for Linux.

### Ready to try?

Follow the guide for [Docker setup on Linux](https://docs.scandipwa.com/docs/installation/docker/linux/) or watch the video guide.

[![docker install](https://i.ibb.co/0MpPFXL/Group-5.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOXSBcCBvCw&list=PLy0PoJ53Gjy3iHQmsZCD1WAazhyS03l-y&index=1)

## Setup on existing Magento

Already have an existing Magento installation? 

ScandiPWA is a regular Magento theme. You can install it on the existing Magento instance using composer.

### Ready to try?

Follow the guide for [setup on existing Magento](https://docs.scandipwa.com/docs/installation/on-existing-m2/) or watch the video guide.

## Setup with a remote server

If you are not planning to developer a back-end functionality, but to modify the front-end only, you can try setting up the theme with the remote Magento 2 server.

> **NOTE!** It is impossible to test the website in production mode (of the webpack build). This is the main downside of this approach.

### Ready to try?

Follow the guide for [setup with remote M2 server](https://docs.scandipwa.com/docs/installation/with-remote-m2/).

## Modularity

The repository is based on Magento 2.3. All components and modules, except the further theme development must be managed by [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).
